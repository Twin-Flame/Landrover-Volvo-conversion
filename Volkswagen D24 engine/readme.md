Volvo d24 turbo Diesel engine, car was rear ended years ago and original owner kept the car in his garage and started the motor every month to keep it fresh as a spare for his other Volvo. After about 15 years of this he finally sold the car to me. After buying it I pulled the drive train and put it on a pallet in my heated and dry shop. The motor is 100% stock and would be a great swap for a Landrover bc it will bolt to the zf auto
